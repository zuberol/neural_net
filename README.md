# Artificial Neural Network implementation
This project was created in Vanilla C++ without any additional libraries.

# What it does?
It can be used in various fields. The most common are classification, data processing or function approximation. There is an example of that last one hardcoded in main.cpp file.

# Example
![example 1](./photos/1.png?raw=true "Example")
![example 2](./photos/2.png?raw=true "Example")
<p align="center" display="block">
  <img src="./photos/1.png" width="500" alt="example photo num 1">
  <img src="./photos/2.png" width="500" alt="example photo num 1">
</p>
## How to run?
```bash
git clone 
cd neural_net
make
./out
```
